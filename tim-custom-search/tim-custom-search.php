Plugin Name: WPAdverts Snippets - Custom Search
Version: 1.0
Author: Greg Winiarski, Tim Sombroek
Description: Allows searching [adverts_list] by passing a 'custom' param with a JSON string for example [adverts_list custom='"cat": "Motorcycles", "type": "Sport", "adverts_location": "The Netherlands", "adverts_price": LE::NUMERIC::10000}'].

// The code below you can paste in your theme functions.php or create
// new plugin and paste the code there.

     /* Shortcode attribute 'custom' makes sure that WPAdverts can load adverts which's properties apply to specific conditions that can be set by the developer.
     *  Those property conditions are set in JSON-format. Here is an example:
     *  {"cat": "Motorcycles", "type": "Sport", "adverts_price": LE::NUMERIC::10000}
     *
     *  In the example above the adverts must be sport motorcycles with a price of â‚¬ 10,000 or below.
     *  The way that the condition of the price range is written, causes the JSON to be invalid.
     *  Why this is important and how this can be used will be explained in a minute.
     *
     *  Such conditions are made up out of 3 parameters:
     *  - The operator, for instance: 'less than' (LT), 'less than or equal to' (LE) or 'greater than' (GT);
     *  - The type of the value (what the value needs to be treated as), for instance: CHAR (as text) or NUMERIC (as number / money value);
     *  - The value that needs to be compared to the value of the advert's property.
     *
     *  Parameters of such a condition are seperated by two double colons, for instance: LE:NUMERIC:10000.
     *  The reason that such a condition results in invalid JSON, is because such a condition is not embedded and should not be embedded by quotes ("...").
     *  It must be written as: LE::NUMERIC::10000, so not as this: "LE:NUMERIC:10000".
     *  I decided it should work this way, because this PHP-code should be able to spot the difference between strings and such conditions.
